<h3>Grading</h3>

<ul>

  <li><b>Homework: 10%</b></li>
  <li><b>Peer Grading: 10%</b>
    <ul>
      <li>4% for completing the peer reviews.</li>
      <li>2% for completing the rating.</li>
      <li>4% for quality of the reviews. This is subjective, but we will glance at the comments you provided, 
	and take into account students' ratings of your comments and the accuracy of your scores. To measure accuracy, 
	we will fit a statistical model to the peer grades at the end of the quarter.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Quizzes: 40%</b>
    <ul>
      <li>We don't want to foster competition, so the grades will not be "curved". (That is, 
      we don't want to say 30% will get A's, 40% B's, and so on. If the whole class does well, then everyone can earn an A.)</li>
      <li>However, the grades will be adjusted upwards as follows: we will determine a 
	mastery score $M$ for each quiz. This score 
	is guaranteed to earn you a solid A (not an A-). All other grades will be 
	adjusted accordingly. The mastery score for the quizzes are:
	<ul>
	  <li>Quiz 1: $M=32$ out of 36</li>
	  <li>Quiz 2: $M=35$ out of 42</li>
	  <li>Quiz 3: $M=30$ out of 42</li>
	  <li>Quiz 4: TBA out of 36</li>
	  <li>Quiz 5: TBA out of 36</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Final: 40%</b></li>

</ul>

  <question>

    <p>The U.S. has bilateral extradition treaties with many countries. (A person charged with a crime in his home country may escape to the U.S.; if he is captured in the U.S., authorities in his home country may request that he be "extradited," that is, turned over for prosecution under their laws.) The Senate attached a special rider to the treaty governing extradition to Northern Ireland: fugitives cannot be returned if they will be discriminated against on the basis of religion. In a leading case, the defense tried to establish discrimination in Northern Ireland's criminal justice system.</p>

    <p>One argument was based on 1991 acquittal rates for persons charged with terrorist offenses. According to a defense expert, these rates were significantly different for Protestants and Catholics. The data are shown below: 8 Protestants out of 15 were acquitted, compared to 27 Catholics out of 65.</p>

    <table class="table"> 
      <thead> 
        <th></th> 
        <th>Protestant</th> 
        <th>Catholic</th> 
      </thead> 
      <tbody>
	<tr> 
          <td><b>Acquitted</b></td> 
          <td>8</td> 
          <td>27</td> 
	</tr> 
	<tr> 
          <td><b>Convicted</b></td> 
          <td>7</td> 
          <td>38</td> 
	</tr> 
      </tbody>
    </table> 

    <p>The defense expert calculated $\chi^2 \approx 6.2$ with 1 degree of freedom, and concluded $P \approx 1\%$. He concluded that this was evidence of discrimination. In this problem, we will check his work.</p>

  <question>
    <p>
      Juniors in Redwood City high school are assigned to 2 math teachers at random. A simple random sample of 100 juniors was followed for 5 years. Out of 50 juniors in Mr. Smith’s class, 28% majored in a STEM field, 42% majored in a different field, and 30% did not go to a 4-year college. Out of 50 juniors in Mr. Chang’s class, 42% majored in a STEM field, 28% majored in a different field, and 30% did not go to a 4-year college. We believe the teachers had an influence on the students’ future path.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perform a hypothesis test. Show your calculations, and please use the table in the book to calculate the $P$-value. Be sure to state the null hypothesis. 
    </p>

    <item type="Long Answer" points="6">
      <solution>
	<h4>Sample Correct Solution</h4>

	<p>The null hypothesis is that teacher and career path are independent.</p>

	<p>We perform a $\chi^2$ test. First, we write down our observations into a table.</p>

	<table class="table">
	  <thead>
	    <th></th>
	    <th>Mr. Smith</th>
	    <th>Mr. Chang</th>
	  </thead>
	  <tbody>
	    <tr>
	      <td>STEM</td>
	      <td>14</td>
	      <td>21</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	      <td>Different Field</td>
	      <td>21</td>
	      <td>14</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	      <td>No 4-year college</td>
	      <td>15</td>
	      <td>15</td>
	    </tr>
	  </tbody>
	</table>

	<p>Under the null hypothesis, we have the following expected counts.</p>

	<table class="table">
	  <thead>
	    <th></th>
	    <th>Mr. Smith</th>
	    <th>Mr. Chang</th>
	  </thead>
	  <tbody>
	    <tr>
	      <td>STEM</td>
	      <td>17.5</td>
	      <td>17.5</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	      <td>Different Field</td>
	      <td>17.5</td>
	      <td>17.5</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	      <td>No 4-year college</td>
	      <td>15</td>
	      <td>15</td>
	    </tr>
	  </tbody>
	</table>

	<p>Calculating the sum of $\frac{(\text{observed} - \text{expected})^2}{\text{expected}}$, we 
	  obtain a $\chi^2 = 2.80$. Comparing this number with the $\chi^2$ table 
	  with $(2-1)(3-1) = 2$ degrees of freedom, the $P$-value is between 10% and 30%. Therefore, 
	  we cannot conclude that the teacher has any impact on students' future path.</p>

	<h4>Grading Rubric</h4>

	<ul>
	  <li>1 point for stating the null hypothesis correctly.</li>
	  <li>1 point for realizing that the $\chi^2$ test should be used.</li>
	  <li>2 points for calculating $\chi^2 = 2.80$.</li>
	  <li>1 point for using 2 degrees of freedom.</li>
	  <li>1 point for determining the $P$-value to be between 10% and 30% from the table.</li>

  <question>

    <p>
      The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial tested the effect of an intervention to 
      reduce risk factors for coronary heart disease — among them, serum cholesterol and 
      smoking. The subjects were 12,866 men age 35-57, at high risk for heart disease. 
      6,428 were randomized to the intervention group and 6,438 to the control. The 
      intervention included counseling on diet and smoking. Subjects were followed for a 
      minimum of 6 years.
    </p>

    <p><b>First, we look at serum cholesterol levels.</b></p>

    <ol type="a">
      <li>On entry to the study, the serum cholesterol level of the intervention group averaged 253.8 mg/dl; their SD was 36.4 mg/dl. For the control group, the figures were 253.5 and 36.8. 
	Test whether cholesterol levels were significantly different (2-sided) between the two groups before the intervention.

      <li>Based on your answers to (a) and (b), what can you conclude?

	<item type="Multiple Choice" points="0.5">
	  <option correct="true">Because the groups had comparable cholesterol levels before the intervention

    <p><b>Next, we look at smoking.</b></p>

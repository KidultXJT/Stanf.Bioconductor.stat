    <p>Below are sketches of histograms for three lists.</p>

    <ol type="a">
      <li>What are the averages of the three histograms?

      <li>The SD of histogram (iii) is around:

      <li>True or false: the SD for histogram (i) is a lot 
smaller than that for histogram (iii).

  <question>
    <p>A study on college students found that the men had an average weight 
      of about 66 kg and an SD of about 9 kg. The women had an average weight 
      of about 55 kg and an SD of 9 kg.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Find the averages and SDs, in pounds. (1 kg = 2.2 lb)

      <li>
	<p>If you took the men and women together, would the

	  just about 9 kg, or bigger than 9 kg?</p>

      <li>
	For women age 25-34 with full time jobs, the average income
	in 2004 was \$32,000. The SD was \$26,000, and 1/4 of 1% had incomes
	above \$150,000. About what percentage with incomes in the range from
	\$32,000 to \$150,000?

	As part of a survey, one large manufacturing company asked a 
	thousand of its employees how far they had to commute to work 
	each day (round trip). The data was analyzed and the average 
	round trip commute distance was reported as 11.3 miles, with 
	an SD of 16.2 miles. What would a rough sketch of the histogram 
	look like? Or is there a mistake somewhere?

  <question>
    Among applicants to one law school, the average LSAT score was about 169,
    the SD was about 9, and the highest score was 178. True or false: the 
    LSAT scores follow the normal curve.

  <question>
    <p>In 2006, Harvard University President Larry Summers resigned 
      over remarks he made about women in math and science. 
      However, contrary to popular belief, what he suggested 
      was not that women are any less intelligent than men (on average), 
      but that women's intelligences are less variable than men's. 
      He noted that among the top 5% of twelfth graders, there was one 
      woman for every two men.</p>

    <p>In this problem, we will show that based on this data, the 
      SD of men's IQs is larger than the SD of women's IQs. This is 
      a challenging problem, so let's walk through the steps 
      together.</p>

    <ul>

      <li>IQ scores follow the normal curve with mean 100 and SD 15. 
	What IQ score marks the cutoff for the top 5% (i.e., the 
	95th percentile)?

	<item type="Short Answer" points="1" />
      </li>

      <li>The percentage of all people with an IQ above the score 
	you calculated in (a) is, of course, 5%, but what percentage 
	of men have an IQ above that score?

	<item type="Short Answer" points="1" />%
      </li>

      <li>You now know the percentage of men with an IQ above the 
	score you calculated in (a). Remember that Summers was 
	assuming that men and women have the same average IQ score 
	(100). This should enable you to determine the SD of men's 
	IQs.

	<item type="Short Answer" points="2" />%
      </li>
      
      <li>Repeat (b) and (c), but for women's IQs. What is the SD of 
	women's IQs?

	<item type="Short Answer" points="2" />%
      </li>

    </ul>

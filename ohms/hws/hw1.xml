  <question>
    <p>In 2006, Harvard University President Larry Summers resigned 
      over remarks he made about women in math and science. 
      However, contrary to popular belief, what he suggested 
      was not that women are any less intelligent than men (on average), 
      but that women's intelligences are less variable than men's. 
      He noted that among the top 5% of twelfth graders, there was one 
      woman for every two men.</p>

    <p>In this problem, we will show that based on this data, the 
      SD of men's IQs is larger than the SD of women's IQs. This is 
      a challenging problem, so let's walk through the steps 
      together.</p>

    <ul>

      <li>IQ scores follow the normal curve with mean 100 and SD 15. 
	What IQ score marks the cutoff for the top 5% (i.e., the 
	95th percentile)?

	<item type="Short Answer" points="1">
	  <answer type="range">[124, 125]</answer>
	</item>
      </li>

      <li>The percentage of all people with an IQ above the score 
	you calculated in (a) is, of course, 5%, but what percentage 
	of men have an IQ above that score? (Remember that men make 
	up about 50% of the population, and that the data show that 
	there are about twice as many men as women in that range.)

	<item type="Short Answer" points="1">
	  <answer type="range">[3.2, 3.4]</answer>
	</item>%
      </li>

      <li>You now know the percentage of men with an IQ above the 
	score in (a). Remember that Summers was 
	assuming that men and women have the same average IQ score 
	(100). This should enable you to determine the SD of men's 
	IQs.

	<item type="Short Answer" points="2">
	  <answer type="range">[16, 17]</answer>
	</item>
      </li>
      
      <li>Repeat (b) and (c), but for women's IQs. What is the SD of 
	women's IQs?

	<item type="Short Answer" points="2">
	  <answer type="range">[13, 14]</answer>

  <question>
    <p>A scientist wants to measure the boiling point of mercury at sea level.
      She makes the following five temperature measurements, in degrees Celsius: 
      353.81, 360.13, 356.22, 359.79, 351.41.
    </p>
    <p>What is the standard deviation of her temperature measurements?</p>
    <item type="Short Answer" points="3">
      <answer type="range">[3.35, 3.4]</answer>
    </item>
    <p>Her boss, however, insists that she take her measurements in degrees Kelvin.
      To convert from Celsius to Kelvin, you simply add 273.15 degrees. Thus,
      the scientist's temperature measurements, expressed in degrees Kelvin,
      are: 626.96, 633.28, 629.37, 632.94, 624.56.
    </p>
    <p>Now what is the standard deviation of her temperatures measurements, (expressed in Kelvin)?</p>

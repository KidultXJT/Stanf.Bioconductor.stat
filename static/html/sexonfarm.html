<SPAN class="articleText"><P>
	Stanford students do date. In fact, 40 percent of Stanford undergraduates are currently in committed relationships, according to a recent Daily survey. And most of those relationships have lasted for more than six months.
</P>
<P>
	But even Stanford singles see action. Roughly one in four single students had had a sexual encounter with someone within the last month.
</P>
<P>
	“The dating trend at Stanford seems to be: either someone is ‘married’ or randomly hooking up,” said Donovan Somera Yisrael, commitment health specialist at Cowell.
</P>
<P>
	“Way to go Stanford,” said sophomore Andrew Baglino, who has been “in and out of a relationship” for the last two years. “Without a doubt, the vibe on campus is that there’s no dating. But, looking at those numbers, it would seem a myth.”
</P>
<P>
	Over the last month, almost 700 undergraduates, or roughly 10 percent of undergraduates, were polled in White Plaza. Roughly equal numbers of males and females, as well as of all four undergraduate years, were represented.
</P>
<P>
	Questions ranged from dating status to frequency of hook-ups to the level of sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
	Freshmen date the least, while sophomores, juniors and seniors date at about the same rate. Freshmen are also the least sexually active. In fact, 37 percent of freshmen claimed never to have hooked up at Stanford. Forty-six percent of sophomores and 50 percent of juniors and seniors have hooked up with another Stanford student within the last month.
</P>
<P>
	“Freshmen are still adjusting to college life,” said Yisrael, who delivers the weekly talk, “Studs, Sluts, Virgins and Wimps,” to houses across campus. “Freshmen are re-establishing themselves and struggling to break free from their social position in high school. It takes time.”
</P>
<P>
	Some students, noting personal experience, said they disagree with the results.
</P>
<P>
	Katherine Hoffman, a student Health Peer Resource Center counselor, noted that she hooked up more freshmen year and that now, as a sophomore, she is in a committed relationship. Hoffman is one of the 66 percent of students who date another Stanford student.
</P>
<P>
	“Freshmen hook up more because freshman year you go to parties and get wasted and then hook up,” sophomore Liz Stryjewski noted.
</P>
<P>
	Sexual Health Peer Resource Center counselor Sam Richardson, a junior, said that Stanford students “may hook up less because we’re so smart.” He said that with intelligence comes a certain element of caution.
</P>
<P>
	“Stanford students weigh the consequences of all their actions so much that they could think themselves out of a hook up.”
</P>
<P>
	“I think [that notion] is absurd,” said senior Marina Hadzopoulofs. “If they hook up less, it is [for] a slightly less responsible reason, like they are too busy or too boring.”
</P>
<P>
	Females polled hook up more frequently and have had more sexual contact than males. In fact, 57 percent of single females have hooked up in the last month, while 33 percent of single males have engaged in sexual activity within the last month. Also, half of the females claim to have hooked up with over 10 different people, while only 26 percent of the men make that claim.
</P>
<P>
	“Girls have it easy,” said junior Santiago Hernandez. “If a girl wants to hook up, she’ll hook up. If a guy wants to, and,  believe me, he does, he has to wine and dine and smooth talk her just to get her to a party.”
</P>
<P>
	Some females think they have it harder. One sophomore wrote on her survey, “Boys just need to ask us out. I do my part, I ask out plenty of boys.”
</P>
<P>
	No comments were available on the gay, lesbian or transgender dating scene.
</P>
<P>
	“It’s much easier to ask someone out on a date than it is to ask someone to hook up,” Baglino said. “Once I realized that, I’ve had a much more active single life.”
</P>
<P>
	The survey says that 62 percent of Stanford students have had sex, which “is a wonderful thing,” according to senior Jim Rohr. “I want that number in the upper 90s when I come back to visit next spring. I’ve done all I can in my time here.”
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Orion Courtin, another SHPRC counselor, said that “people definitely have sex at Stanford. Before a long weekend like Memorial Day, I give condoms to at least nine people during my hour-long shift.”
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed that more than 75 percent of Stanford sex occurs within relationships, and that 63 percent of people in relationships were engaging in sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
	The survey’s results may have been different had it been taken during another quarter. For example, the SHPRC has given away over 3,810 condoms this quarter, a number up from 3,200 passed out fall and winter quarters combined. Courtin said he believes that springtime rewards students for a year’s worth of courting.
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Chris Van Dyke said he agrees. “The springtime is the right time for love,” he said. “I’ve been to the SHPRC four different times this quarter with four different I.D. numbers.”
</P>
<P>
	Yisrael said students hook up more during the spring in part because they realize that next year they won’t be living with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	“When the Draw results come out, students realize that their time together is limited. Some pressures may be lifted, and students will allow hookups to happen.”
</P>
<P>
	Responses for the best place to take a date in the Stanford area ranged from a picnic along Skyline Blvd. to betting on horses at Bay Meadows Race Track, from touring the Pez Museum to an evening on the Psychology Building roof.  
</P>
<P>
	However, according to the survey, the most perfect date would begin with a picnic in the Foothills, followed by a shopping spree at Fry’s Electronics. The couple would share the popular movie, “The Adventures of Joe Dirt,” before dining at Pasta? on University Avenue. The lovers would travel to San Francisco to enjoy a Joe Goode Performance Group dance, catch the end of a concert at Bimbo’s and return to campus for steam tunneling.
</P>
<P>
	“After a date like that,” said sophomore Mike Pappas, “I would be Jell-O in her hands, a fish helplessly biting at a baited hook.”
</P>
<P>
	One junior explained some difficulties with dating at Stanford on his survey. “During freshman orientation, all we heard about was how there was no dating at Stanford,” he said. “So we haven’t even tested the waters and already have this negative opinion of the dating scene.”
</P>
<P>
	Another junior said that “Stanford students are too busy and wrapped up in their classes to even go out, let alone date.” When this junior submitted her survey, she squinted her eyes and said, “This was a horrible reminder of reality.” She echoed the sentiment of many respondents, male and female, old and young, who expressed disappointment with their personal dating history. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 50 percent of respondents are never ‘sexiled’ — that is, forced to sleep elsewhere in order to provide privacy for roommates and their dates — 15 percent reported that they “never leave the room while the nasty is happening.”
</P>
<P>
	“I live in a triple,” Pappas continued. “It’s not uncommon for there to be six, sometimes seven people in there at once. After the first three weeks, it stopped being weird. Actually, it gets kind of lonely when there’s just three of us in there.”
</P>
<P>
	Yisrael said that the modern dating scene is complicated because “society did away with the misogynist custom of men asking out women. But we didn’t replace it with anything.” He said that many women still don’t feel comfortable asking out men, and “men are seen as sketchy if they ask out too many girls. So, instead of a date, students have to go get coffee or study together to relieve the pressure of a date.”
